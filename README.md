# ðŸ“– Tokenizing a Short Story for LLM Training (Educational Version)

This repository demonstrates how to tokenize a short story using Python's built-in libraries as a simulation of the preprocessing steps used in Large Language Model (LLM) training. It serves as an educational introduction to text tokenizationâ€”a foundational step in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
